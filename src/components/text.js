    '"Lazuage" is just a bit of fun and is by no means a replacement for formal linguistic training. This quiz game was born on a rainy sunday afternoon with the rationale being two-fold; to create a fun safe space for me to learn some React.js and to learn some basic Croatian phrases for my then upcoming holiday to the beautiful country. While initally it was a stateless front end app, it has since evolved to a full scale Create Read Update Delete app, hosted on aws using lambda, api gateway and ec2. Please feel free to modify this game in any way you want, and have fun!',
